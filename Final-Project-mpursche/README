Final Project - Max Pursche
Be sure to have free glut installed and in the cmake-build-debug folder for proper compilation!
This can be run on Apple and Windows

Summary:
This is snake game using Glut and OpenGL from module 4, I use polymorphism from module 2 with the subclass snake which has functions for checking overlap and score counting.
You start the game by pressing 's', the score is posted in the center of the screen and will add once per eaten apple.
You cannot touch the sides of the screen, and the head cannot touch the tail otherwise you will lose the game.
